22.09.2020 UPDATE!

Nvidia actually implemented captcha on their checkout page. This means that minimal and checkout modes in config.yaml will still work but full will not (as this bot doesn't resolve captchas). So take this into account - feel free to keep on using it to refresh the Nvidia page and to fill your address but you will have to solve the captcha and actually click on submit when bot is done. 

First and foremost - go visit the config.yaml file and fill it correctly. 
Second - you will need Firefox browser in the latest version and Geckodriver. You can obtain Geckodriver here:
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

Download it and unpack it to the same directory as the program. 

Then let's check if bot works correctly for you - enter 'checkout' in the mode field and your actual information.
Then put '2060S' as a card (as this one is actually available so we can go through checkout process safely)

Then run the bot - within few seconds it should get you to a summary page. Ensure that product is correct and that your information is entered. 

Done all that? Nice! Now and only now can you turn off the bot and the browser, change the mode to 'full' and GPU to the one you actually want to buy. 

Note - I actually hope you don't buy the card with it and by the time you download this tool it will no longer work. If it still does it means they really don't care about anti bot security.
