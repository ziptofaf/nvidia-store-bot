First and foremost - go visit the config.yaml file and fill it correctly. 
Second - you will need Firefox browser in the latest version and Geckodriver. You can obtain Geckodriver here:
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

Download it and unpack it to the same directory as the program. 

Then let's check if bot works correctly for you - enter 'checkout' in the mode field and your actual information.
Then put '2060S' as a card (as this one is actually available so we can go through checkout process safely)

Then run the bot - within few seconds it should get you to a summary page. Ensure that product is correct and that your information is entered. 

Done all that? Nice! Now and only now can you turn off the bot and the browser, change the mode to 'full' and GPU to the one you actually want to buy.
